# Collabamap

## Blessing for the Hackathon

May your code compile without errors,
May your APIs respond with grace,
May your database queries execute swiftly,
And may your Git commits never conflict.

As you collaborate on this map project,
May creativity flow like well-structured JSON,
May your FastAPI endpoints serve without fail,
And may your Python dependencies resolve peacefully.

In these 24 hours of focused creation,
May caffeine fuel your minds and fingers,
May brilliant solutions come when most needed,
And may your demo impress all who witness it.

Good luck, team CollabaMap!
The clock is ticking, but your skills are mighty.
